# Stub
Stub is a POC project to highlight an issue with Secure Password Systems.

Password security is often Bypassed using insecure password extensions - called Password Stubs.
 
This repository is a collection of built and found password stubs for cyber security testing.
 
Each Stub adds x2 to the completion time - remember that.

These password extensions ( stubs ) are often used in conjunction with vulnerable passwords to trick the password security system into believing the password is secure - this is a common thing people do to bypass the password requirements of most websites.
 
Vulnerable Weak Password + Number & Symbol = Strong Password Bypass
   
    
#### For example,   
Q. Add a password to your account ?    
A. JohnSmith    
Q. This password is too weak !    
A. JohnSmith+(STUBS)    
A. Password Set Successfully.   
 

This common usage scenario highlights how people are combining common stubs with common passwords to bypass password security restrictions.
     
NEVER USE A WEAK STUB !!!
